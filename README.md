## ProCTRL
# How do I use ProCTRL?
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, have a [Discord application/bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) created.
ProCTRL is fairly easy to use, first, you will need to download all of the code.
After this, run the setup.bat file. This will start the setup. Please give it all the required details.
When this is done, open the run.bat to finally start the bot.
Pretty easy, ain't it?
# The home of ProCTRL!
ProCTRL is the best way of managing your pc from within a Discord bot.
# Why does it exist?
~~Because it can~~ Because I feel like this can be useful or just generally fun to experiment with for people.
