## ProCTRL
# How do I use ProCTRL?
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, have a [Discord application/bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) created.
ProCTRL is fairly easy to use, first, you will need to download all of the code.
Go to `%appdata%` on file explorer and when it goes to `roaming` go back to the `AppData` folder, then open `Local`, `Programs`, `Python`, `Python39`, `Lib` and `site-packages`. After drag in the folder `pypresence` that is included in the code you downloaded. This is the `pypresence` module, the reasoning for not having it install automatically is because it doesn't work most of the time if you do so.
After this, run the setup.bat file. This will start the setup. Please give it all the required details.
When this is done, open the run.bat to finally start the bot.
Pretty easy, ain't it?

# Why does it exist?
~~Because it can~~ Because I feel like this can be useful or just generally fun to experiment with for people.
