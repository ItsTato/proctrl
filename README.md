## ProCTRL
# How do I use ProCTRL?
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and have a [Discord application/bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) created and ready (you will be asked details about it whilt setting it up, also, please have the guild id of the guild the bot will run on ready).
ProCTRL is fairly easy to use, first, you will need to download all of the code.
After this, run the `setup.bat` file. This will start the setup. Please give it all the required details.
When this is done, open the `run.bat` to finally start the bot.
Pretty easy, ain't it?
